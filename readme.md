# ulti.js.org

I got this domain because https://github.com/js-org/js.org/pull/7076 👀

The content of the page is on the [ulti.js.org](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/ultirequiem.github.io/tree/ulti.js.org) branch.

Before this was a redirector to my new site, the code is hosted on the [old-redirector](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/ultirequiem.github.io/tree/old-redirector) branch.
